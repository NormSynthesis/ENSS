# The SENSE project
Welcome to the website of the SENSE project, an open source software platform for the synthesis of Evolutionarily Stable and Effective normative systems for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). By considering basic information about a MAS, such as the composition of its agent population and the type of situations that the agents can interact in, SENSE allows to predict (to synthesise) norms to achieve successful  coordination between the agents.   

## What is SENSE and how does it work?
SENSE synthesises norms by employing [Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory), a mathematical framework that allows to simulate the evolution of strategy adoption in Multi-Agent Systems. In EGT, strategy evolution allows to predict which strategies are Evolutionarily Stable Strategies (ESS), that is, strategies that, once established in a population, every agent will prefer to conform on the assumption that everybody else does. 

Similarly, SENSE considers a representation of a MAS as a game-theoretic setting in which the agents can play one or more games. Each game represents a particular situation in which two or more agents interact,
